# Overview

The `knapsack` package provides three exported functions to solve solve knapsack problem. An extra Rcpp version of brute_force_knapsack also provided.

# Installation

To install the `knapsack` package, use the following commands:

```{r install-linreg-package, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("qqyfly/732A94_Advanced_Programming_in_R_Lab6", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Load required libraries

In this step, we need to load the installed library `knapsack`. The code is showed below.

```{r}
library(knapsack)
```

# Load the test data

Some test data is needed to execute the function.

```{r}
suppressWarnings(RNGversion(min(as.character(getRversion()),"3.5.3")))
set.seed(42, kind = "Mersenne-Twister", normal.kind = "Inversion")
n <- 2000
knapsack_objects <- data.frame(
  w=sample(1:4000, size = n, replace = TRUE),
  v=runif(n = n, 0, 10000)
)
```

## brute force knapsack R version
```{r}
brute_force_knapsack(x = knapsack_objects[1:8,], W = 3500)
```


##  dynamic knapsack
```{r}
knapsack_dynamic(x = knapsack_objects[1:8,], W = 2000)
```

## greedy knapsack
```{r}
greedy_knapsack(x = knapsack_objects[1:8,], W = 3500)
```

## brute force knapsack Rcpp version
```{r}
brute_force_knapsack(x = knapsack_objects[1:8,], W = 3500, fast = TRUE)
```

## Questions and Answers
Question for Brute force search: How much time does it takes to run the algorithm for n = 16 objects?
```{r}
system.time(brute_force_knapsack(x = knapsack_objects[1:16,], W = 3500))
```

Question for Greedy heuristic: How much time does it takes to run the algorithm for n = 500 objects?
```{r}
system.time(knapsack_dynamic(x = knapsack_objects[1:500,], W = 3500))
```

Question for Greedy heuristic: How much time does it takes to run the algorithm for n = 1000000 objects?
```{r}
system.time(greedy_knapsack(x = knapsack_objects[1:1000000,], W = 3500))
```

Question after profile: What performance gain could you get by trying to improving your code?

Answer: We can  use C++ to rewrite the code to get huge improvement, the following result using the same data but with C++ implementation.
